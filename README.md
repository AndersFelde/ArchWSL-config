# Arch WSL config
## Install
#### 1. [Download](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL/releases/latest) installer zip file.

#### 2. Extract all files in the zip file to the same directory.
Please extract to a folder that you have full access permission.
For example, 'Program Files' can not be used.

#### 3. Run Arch.exe to Extract rootfs and Register to WSL.
Also, the name of the EXE file is used as the name of your WSL instance.
That means, if you copy multiple EXE files and rename them to different names, you can have multiple different ArchWSL at the same time without conflict.
